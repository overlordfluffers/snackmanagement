# Project Title

This application serves as an intial survey application to be used by units.

## Getting Started

There are 2 commands that need to be run in order to start the application for development reasons. First run `npm start` this starts the backend Express server. Next in order to compile the frontend code via webpack run `npm run build`. To start the server without running it in docker you simply can run `npm start`. This will serve the files via `localhost:3000`
